A simple web application that predicts the type of fruit based on physical measurements such as height, width, mass, and color score.
Multiple machine learning algorithms were trained and compared to determine the most suitable model for this dataset.
The final model, Random Forest, provides predictions along with a confidence score. 
The application uses Flask for the backend API and React.js for the frontend interface
